## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate Astrophysicist with experience in Physics and Python. I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions.

- 🌱 Currently learning: SQL, JavaScript, Java, Tableau
- 🔭 Focusing on: displaying my book library online with beautiful plots and histograms
- 🌍 Languages: Python, C/C++, ..., Italian, English, and some basic Norwegian!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I currently maintain a **[newsletter]**([lastscatteringsurface.substack.com]), and I wrote a small book of fiction (but I got it off the shelves :/)
