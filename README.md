## About Me 

I'm an Astrophysicist graduate and I love science, technology, and philosophy.  
I have experience in Physics and Python.  
I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills (and languages!), and working with data and numbers.

- Currently learning: SQL, JavaScript, Java, Tableau
- Focusing on: displaying my book library online with beautiful plots and histograms
- Languages: Python, C/C++, ..., Italian, English, and some basic Norwegian!
- Fun fact: I currently maintain a newsletter (https://lastscatteringsurface.substack.com), and I wrote a small book of fiction (but I got it off the shelves :/)
